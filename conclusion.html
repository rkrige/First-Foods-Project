		<h1>Conclusion</h1>
		<p> a.	My research would be a significant improvement over past research because it would be used in conjunction with soil testing occurring on PCCâ€™s RCESC camas fields. 
b.	The soil contamination testing would ensure that the camas is safe to eat for indigenous community members while my interviews would be used to show the non-indigenous public why access to first foods is important and should be invested in 
c.	I will actively be working alongside Indigenous community members ensuring I deploy decolonization strategies and working with them to ensure their voice shows through in the final product and not my interpretation of what their voice is.
