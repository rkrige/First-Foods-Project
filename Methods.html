		<h1>Methods</h1>
		<p> a.	Primary, Descriptive Data
i.	I am going to use a combination of a questionnaire and interviews to test my hypothesis 
b.	This is the best method to use for my research because I want to be able to use Indigenous people’s own words to describe why camas is important to them instead of me trying to interpret why 
i.	Additionally, there is not much public information available to me on this topic so it’s difficult to do research on this through a literature review 

c.	Create a questionnaire 
i.	This will be sent out to indigenous community members to get a sense of topics they are comfortable talking about and want to talk about 
1.	Questionnaire would include questions such as 
a.	Please rate on a scale of one to ten how comfortable you are talking about camas to non-indigenous person 
b.	Please rate how comfortable you are talking about environmental justice issues that could be leading to a decrease in camas accessibility 
c.	Please rate how comfortable you are discussing TEK with a non-indigenous person 
d.	Please list topics that you generally enjoy talking about and sharing. 
ii.	This will help give power to the indigenous people being interviewed, so they can really steer the questions in a direction they want to talk about and share
d.	Conduct interviews 
i.	These interviews will be recorded 
ii.	I can transcribe and code them based on the recording 
1.	In vivo transcription method 
iii.	I’m choosing to use interviews because there is not any peer-reviewed work on the specific topic I am looking into 
iv.	The interview questions would be based on answers to the questionnaire
e.	Participants 
i.	Ask Valence Brenneis for contacts 
1.	People who asked to conduct the soil testing in the RCESC originally 
ii.	I would like to interview these indigenous community members specifically because they seem invested in creating more awareness around cultivating camas fields as a place for first foods and also as a safe place to practice their culture.
