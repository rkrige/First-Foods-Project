		<h1>Methods</h1>
		<h2>How I would Collect Data</h2>
		<p> 
			
			I am going to use primary, descriptive data in the forms of a questionnaire and then interviews to test my hypothesis. This is the best method for my research because I want to use Indigenous people’s own words to describe why camas is important to them instead of me summarizing what I think is important. It’s necessary to use this primary data because there is so little public information available to me on this topic that it would not be very beneficial to do a literature review. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The questionnaire I create will be sent out to Indigenous community members who are interested in the study to get a sense of topics they are comfortable talking about, and what I should focus on during the interview. These community members would be Indigenous folks who are interested in ecology or environmental justice. Initially, community members who submitted letters of support for the TWIG grant proposal will be contacted first, as it’s the most likely that they have the most vested interest in this project. The questionnaire they fill out would include questions such as: 
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>-Please rate on a scale of one to ten how comfortable you are talking about camas to a non-Indigenous person</li>
				<li>-Please rate how comfortable you are talking about environmental justice issues that could be leading to a decrease in camas availability</li>
				<li>-Please rate how comfortable you are discussing TEK with a non-Indigenous person</li>
				<li>-Please list topics that you generally enjoy talking about and sharing</li>
		        </ul>
		</p>
		<p>
		       
		         The purpose of this questionnaire it to give power to the Indigenous people being interviewed, so they feel comfortable steering the questions in any direction they would like to discuss and share. 
			<br> 
			<br>
			In the interview portion of this study, conversation between Indigenous community members and I will be recorded in order to portray the conversation exactly how the Indigenous community explains them. The specifics of interview questions would be based directly on feedback from the questionnaire and may be different for each individual. The interviews will then be transcribed in an in vivo transcription method and coded. 
			<br>
			<br>
			If the results from the interviews confirmed my initial hypothesis, it would look like shared and lived experiences referring to limited or not safe access to camas and maybe first foods generally. A result that would not confirm my predictions would look like Indigenous community members who have never experienced difficulty gaining safe access to camas or first foods. 
			<br>
			<br>
			As a non-native person, it’s particularly important for me to focus on how to decolonize my work and this study. Decolonization strategies I would implement would include transcripts or recordings of topics explained in Indigenous language when appropriate. I would include video clips when the concept requires a relationship and understanding of the land surrounding it. The beginning of the study will include a land acknowledgment and a brief history of the genocide of Indigenous people by colonizers.
