		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p> 
			- I am going to study how soil contamination effects access of first foods for indigenous people 
			<br>
			- As begin interviewing people for this, I would be okay if the topic were to naturally broaden to other barriers the prevent indigenous people from foraging for first foods
				-Example: loss of land, loss of the plants themselves 
			<br>
			-This area is important to study because it helps bring attention to the needs of indigenous communities 
			<br>
			-Many of these communities face higher rates of illness from various diseases as well as higher rates of suicide 
			<br>
			-Some members of the community have attributed these problems to the lack of access to culturally significant plants and animals. 
			<br> 
			-Itâ€™s also important for me as a white person to use that privilege to try to amplify a problem that is not getting enough attention
			<br>
			-It is important for the original stewards of this land to have access to their own land
