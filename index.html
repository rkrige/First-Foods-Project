		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p> a.	I am going to study how soil contamination effects access of first foods for indigenous people 
i.	As begin interviewing people for this, I would be okay if the topic were to naturally broaden to other barriers the prevent indigenous people from foraging for first foods
1.	Example: loss of land, loss of the plants themselves 
b.	This area is important to study because it helps bring attention to the needs of indigenous communities 
i.	Many of these communities face higher rates of illness from various diseases as well as higher rates of suicide 
1.	Some members of the community have attributed these problems to the lack of access to culturally significant plants and animals. 
ii.	Itâ€™s also important for me as a white person to use that privilege to try to amplify a problem that is not getting enough attention
iii.	It is important for the original stewards of this land to have access to their own land
