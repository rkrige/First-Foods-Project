		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p> 
			 I am going to study how soil contamination effects access of first foods for indigenous people. As I begin interviewing people on this topic, I would be open to the topic naturally broadening to other barriers that prevent indigenous people from foraging for first foods. For example, some ideas that come to my mind is that Indigenous people may want to speak about the major amounts of land that was and is taken from this since colonization which has also led to a decrease in abundance of first food plants themselves. 
			<br>
			This topic is important to study because it helps bring attention to the needs of indigenous communities that are overlooked far too regularly. Many of these communities face higher rates of illness from various diseases as well as higher rates of suicide. Some members of the community have attributed these problems to the lack of access to culturally significant plants and animals. It is critical that the original stewards of this land regain access their own land. Lastly, I recognize the privilege I hold as a white person and a person able to receive a higher education. I would like to use these privileges to better support the community around me.
