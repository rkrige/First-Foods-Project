		<h1>Background</h1>
		<p>a.	What is already known about the field 
i.	Settlers drained fields of camas when colonizing Oregon 
1.	(Brousseau, 2021)
ii.	Simply put, camas is less available and accessible than before 
iii.	Environmental Injustice 
1.	Indigenous communities (and their soils) are put in harmâ€™s way for implementation of things such as oil pipelines
a.	(Jonasson et al., 2019)
2.	Contaminated soils in the area can lead to contaminated food 
b.	Gap in literature 
i.	Very difficult to find peer-reviewed sources on indigenous relationships to first foods
ii.	Very little peer-reviewed information exists on how soil contamination disproportionately affects Indigenous communities 
1.	Especially in the United States
2.	And Oregon 
c.	My questions 
i.	Do the Kalapuya (confederated tribe of the Grand Ronde)  people have access to camas >
ii.	Does soil contamination limit their access to camas ?
