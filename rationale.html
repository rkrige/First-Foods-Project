		<h1>Rationale</h1>
		<p> 
			By understanding the current limitations of camas growth and harvest, I can help create more awareness around a specific issue that there’s not a lot of literature written on currently. Due to the lack of literature on the subject, I’d like to know if there is awareness of soil contamination being a potential issue in Indigenous communities. If there isn’t information or data on soil contamination in the area, then this presents a need for soil testing in the community. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Based on my background knowledge and research on soil contamination in camas fields, I think that camas fields closer to the Grand Ronde Reservation will be more likely to have contaminated soils, and that camas fields found in places further away will be less likely to be contaminated. If my prediction is correct then it will show that Indigenous communities are being disproportionately affected by environmental issues, and they need to be invested in more than they currently are. If my prediction is incorrect, then access to camas fields may be affected by factors that I have not considered. Even further, perhaps Indigenous communities feel fine about finding camas to harvest, but they are lacking access to another culturally significant first food that I have not considered.
