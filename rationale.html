		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p> a.	How much access do Indigenous community members have to camas fields? 
i.	Understanding the current limitations of camas can help create awareness around an issue that there’s not a lot of literature about currently 
b.	Does soil contamination limit their access to camas? 
i.	I want to know if there is awareness of this potential issue in indigenous communities 
ii.	If there isn’t any data or information on this topic, then it will present a need for soil testing in this community
